- 👋 Hi, I'm @U45842209, also known as Marc.
- 👀 I'm interested in networking, self-hosting, and development.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm working part-time at Orange Business, where I'm learning about legacy copper links and fiber optics.
- 💞️ I'm open to collaborating on any project and with anyone, as long as I can learn from it.
- 📫 You can reach me at marc.tahon.dujardin.bis@gmail.com.
- 📖 Although I'm a native French speaker, feel free to communicate with me in English, both in writing and speaking.
- ✨ The accomplishment I'm most proud of is my homelab. I have built a network for myself and my family, which has been a rewarding experience. Currently, I'm working on setting up a functional JellySeer and JellyFin system, which I find exciting.
